# XR P3 Studio 3 @ UMich EECS 440

## Unreal Engine version

Please use **Unreal Engine 5.2.1** (available at Vis Studio).

## Work on your own branch

To avoid merge conflict.

In general, individuals are responsible for merging, ask for help on discord if you are not sure.

## Potential Uassets issue

Uassets could become **invalid** due to git-lfs, so be careful.

You can **test** after merging own branch into main, before the issue becomes catastrophic.

## Work on your own level (Under Scenes)

We will come back and merge everyone's work once it is done.

But you can **create your own folder** and place everything inside if you want to.

## File structures and naming conventions to be determined

Hmm.
